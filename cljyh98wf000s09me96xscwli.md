## Community Section

We had a lot of fun and learning in June with our weekly coffee chats and a workshop on APIs. Here are some highlights from each event:

* **Coffee chat (2023-06-03):** Through a friendly conversation we shared what we were learning at the moment, what projects we were building, and our experiences with the developer community. We learned about different technologies and frameworks that our members are using, such as React, Flutter, Django, and more. We also discussed some of the challenges and benefits of being a developer in today's world.
    
* **Coffee chat (2023-06-10):** We followed up on our previous week's conversation and also talked about hackathons and how they had helped spark our interest in developing software. We shared some tips and tricks on how to prepare for hackathons, how to find teammates, how to pitch ideas, and how to have fun while coding. We also celebrated some of the achievements of our members who participated in recent hackathons and won prizes or recognition.
    
* **APIs with Keploy workshop (2023-06-16):** Shivang Shandilya and Diganta Dr Banik, members of the Keploy DevRel team, held a session on what APIs are and how we can test them using [keploy.io](http://keploy.io). They explained the basics of APIs, such as HTTP methods, endpoints, parameters, headers, and responses. They also demonstrated how to use [keploy.io](http://keploy.io) to create mock APIs, test them with different tools, and monitor their performance. They also answered some of the questions that our members had about APIs and [keploy.io](http://keploy.io).
