# ✅How to use AI in Web Dev

Ranging from code writing to improving user experience, AI is already used in various aspects of web development. Here’s what that looks like:

**1)Coding Assistants:** Coding programs can be used by experienced programmers to help them write more code without typing as much themselves. Programs like Codex or Github’s Copilot can help programmers by suggesting the next line of the code they’re working on or assembling small blocks of code for the programmer to use.

**2)Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI):** An ADI creates complete and functional e-commerce websites for users, covering everything from aesthetic design to structure and content. By asking users a few simple questions and drawing on the masses of data it’s been trained on, an ADI can design a site that fits any purpose and any sense of taste. Wix ADI can either generate a website from start to finish or guide a user on how to build the site themselves.

**3)Smart Chatbots for a Personalized End-User Experience:** Utilizing an AI-powered chatbot helps users instantly find the information they need without having to search for it manually. Users can type a natural language question to the chatbot and receive answers and links instantly. Intercom provides AI-based chatbots to companies that integrate right into websites, apps, or other software.

**4)Voice-Based Interactions for a Convenient Search Experience:** Like smart chatbots, voice-based searches provide a quicker and easier user interface method for finding information. Apple’s virtual assistant [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/) can retrieve information and complete tasks through spoken commands. It works alongside multiple other devices and can communicate with them across long distances. Google Assistant also has similar features.

**5)Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Made Easier:** An SEO AI can provide all of this information for you. It can generate top-performing headlines and topics for you to write about, and give you all the keywords you need to include to make it rank well. [SEO.ai](http://SEO.ai) is a search engine optimization software that helps people craft high-performing content quickly and efficiently.

## ✅How to Integrate AI into a website

A company’s website is the equivalent of a digital first impression. Without the right tools, your website might make the wrong first impression — losing valuable business for your company.

Here’s where artificial intelligence can help. The newest AI technologies can elevate and transform your business website to improve the customer experience and generate more conversions. Here are 11 advanced ways to use AI to improve your business website.

### **1\. Website Creation**

Designing and building a website is a complicated process — particularly for those with little experience. Luckily, many popular website platforms now leverage the power of artificial intelligence to make website creation easier. Using these technologically advanced platforms, you can enter a few basic data points and have a fully optimized website created for you.

### **2\. Search Engine Optimization**

If your website doesn’t show up for the appropriate search queries, you’ll have a difficult time attracting new visits and new business. In the past, SEO was somewhat of a mystery. But now, with artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced SEO tools can quickly identify website problems and offer feedback to improve your search rankings.

### **3\. Real-time Personalization**

Personalized marketing is a requirement these days. Your customers not only want personalized content, they expect it. The only hang-up here is that it’s time-consuming and expensive to collect information about visitors and then serve them perfectly timed and targeted content. AI, however, streamlines and scales this process.

### **4\. Content Creation**

Content marketing is the go-to strategy for many marketers, and for good reason: content marketing generates about three times as many leads and is 62% less expensive than [outbound marketing tactics](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/10/stats-invest-content-marketing/). With the help of artificial intelligence, marketers now have access to more information about how people consume and interact with their content.

### **5\. Online Customer Service**

AI-based systems like chatbots and automated user flows have transformed the world of customer service. These tools can analyze a user’s question and serve a response based on language and behaviour cues.

### **6\. Content Curation**

AI can supplement the content process in other ways as well — specifically by curating content. The latest technology uses machine learning to analyze a website visitor’s behaviour and curate a library of content that speaks to that specific person’s wants and needs. It can be used to suggest helpful articles, and interesting products, and keep your audience engaged longer than if they were searching for content themselves.

### **7\. Design and User Experience**

One of the most useful applications of AI is design and user experience optimization. AI gathers behavioural data in real-time to produce actionable feedback marketers can use to improve the user experience of their website. More advanced tools can even make these changes on the fly.

Think about how much more effective your A/B tests or UX experiments would be if you could implement them in real-time, based on one specific user’s behavior. Quickly change the layout of a page, reduce the number of form fields, or even swap out a banner image on the fly.

The best part? AI removes the guesswork. All ‘decisions’ made by AI tools and technologies are founded on real data analysis. Aside from making your marketing more effective,  AI makes it more strategic and purposeful.

# ✅Role of AI in Web Dev

Currently, the world of web development is fuelled by the collaboration of artificial and human intelligence. AI can’t do the job alone, and humans no longer need to. Most AI use cases in web development complement the work human programmers do and help the development process progress more efficiently.

The role of AI can be summarized as follows:

* It is an essential technology in the modern world that is built upon the assumption that you can“Let the Machine Play Your Role”. For example, production, recycling, development, design, transportation, infrastructure production and more can be controlled by machines instead of humans.
    
* It emphasizes the development of smart and intelligent machines that act like humans. For example, an AI-enabled machine can help a doctor identify diseases from an image, it can control both air and ground traffic, and so on.
    
* It boosts user experience by creating strong human connections by improving social listening, data analysis, and facial recognition. This allows companies to know their customers' behaviour at an advanced and intimate level.
    
* It’s inbuilt with virtual robots and innovative technology to provide efficient functioning just like humans. For example, the Amazon Echo, popularly called Alexa, is a virtual assistant developed by Amazon.
    

# ✅Will AI replace Web Developers

AI is not going to replace web developers any time soon. The current technology isn’t designed to write a whole project from scratch—it’s designed to complement human programmers and make their jobs a little easier.

Other types of artificial intelligence are made to design solutions based on data, but at a scale that humans could never achieve alone. They help us achieve things that weren’t possible before, or help optimize tasks we were already doing so that humans can focus on the jobs that AI is still very incapable of.

Some ways through which we can use AI are:

**•Use AI to help with a job, not to do a job for you.** One of the most important things to remember is human intervention is always needed when dealing with AI-written code. They’re branded as “assistants” because they need to work with you, not for you.

**•Think about how AI can help users.** Using artificial intelligence for web development doesn’t just mean using coding assistants. They can also be used to help users interact with websites and brands in new and more efficient ways, for example, customer experience and support chatbots.

**•Delegate low-level work to AI to free up your time.** When used correctly, AI can help programmers spend more time working on new and complex tasks, and less time on basic maintenance. This helps increase productivity and the value of the work you output.

# ✅ Conclusion

Although web development and AI have been working co-dependently, there’s no reason for website developers and designers to feel a threat from artificial intelligence. AI can never replace the ideas of the human mind. It can only perform repetitive and monotonous tasks.

However, website designers and developers must learn about artificial intelligence to truly utilize what it has to offer. Because shortly, AI would be a bigger part of web development, considering how fast it’s growing. Therefore, being well-versed in the field has now become essential for aspiring web developers.

Thus, instead of seeing AI as a threat that might replace web development, businesses should view AI as an empowering tool that can aid in everyday tasks that require time and effort.
