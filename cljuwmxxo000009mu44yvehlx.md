# Introduction

**Are you tired of studying in private and not seeing the benefits of your learning? Have you ever considered the idea of sharing your learning process with others?‎‎‎‎ ‎‎‎‎‎ Do you want to earn recognition from people in your field?**

*If your answer to these questions was a resounding yes then this blog is just perfect for you!!!*

The practice of <mark>#LearnInPublic</mark> or <mark>Learning In Public</mark> could be the key to unlocking your full potential as a programmer. In this article, we will explore the power of learning in public, the benefits it can bring to programmers, and how to get started on your learning journey.

So get ready to step out of your comfort zone and join the community of learners who are actively sharing their knowledge and experiences.

You are well aware that **learning is a lifelong endeavour**. However, the majority lurk and "study in private". They **only consume material, not produce any,** which is a passive form of learning which is comfortable but not as beneficial as creating material you create and sharing it everywhere. But the topic of our discussion today is being at **the top of the system**.

What you do to reach the top is develop a practice of producing a learning exhaust, a trail of presence online of the work you do - by the practice of **#LearnInPublic.** Except for your worries, there are **no longer any obstacles** preventing you from building your profession.

Nowadays, **a degree is not necessary** for many occupations. Showing off your talent and commitment to the craft you've chosen to pursue is what counts.

You do it when you **learn in front of others**. Even before you feel ready, you post online about your skill improvement and ongoing projects.

# Learning In Public :

**Learning in public** means actively sharing your learning process with others, often through public channels such as social media, blogs, or online communities.

A movement called "**learning in public**" coined by [Shawn "Swyx" Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) encourages the formation of *Learning Exhaust* through the supplementary information created as a result of education. Throughout this type of "\***anti-marketing"**, the **content is seen as the goal** in and of itself (as a way to draw attention and clients to a business).

In the same way that **writing does not aid in learning; it IS how we learn**, learning in public considers content as a necessary result of actual learning over passive learning limited to the self.

**David Perell** recommends people write content online and says in [**The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online**](https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/) :

> *When you publish ideas, you create your own “****Serendipity Vehicle****” — a magnet for ideas and people and opportunities from potentially every corner of the globe. If your ideas resonate with people, people will discover you and bring you unexpected opportunities. They’ll open doors you never knew existed.*

This is akin to Swyx's concept of creating a **"learning exhaust"** - through "**Learning in Public**". You learn-Share-Apply and inspire others to do the same. It works to connect you with like-minded people and attract intelligent audiences ultimately leading to unexpected opportunities.

> ### \*Anti-Marketing :
> 
> Authenticity is the cornerstone of anti-marketing. Although it employs a very different strategy to do so, anti-marketing pursues the same essential objectives as marketing. Anti-marketing focuses more on revealing your relatable and important qualities than it does on putting your best foot forward.
> 
> By operating with the "[garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)" (*When you ask people to see your work before it is complete, you are inviting them to take an "inside peek" at how you are working.*) and removing the cloak of secrecy, you can engage people in your process rather than just the final result.

# **Why it always works :**

Learning in public encourages you to explain what you simply know to others. It enhances your understanding of new concepts, helping you remember what you learn. The knowledge shared in public acts as a reference for new projects or ideas.

There’s more to learning from experiential learning than passive learning.

> “Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.”
> 
> \- Aristotle

Learning from what works and what doesn't **gives** a real **sense** **of** progress than just accumulating knowledge. **Public** **sharing** is also a great way to **uncover** blind spots in your **thought** process. **This** can help you fill in your **knowledge** **gaps.** Second learning reinforces knowledge and helps me find even better ways to retain and teach new knowledge.

> People frequently lack confidence in their writing abilities and believe that topics they could write about have already been covered by authors with more knowledge or stronger writing abilities.
> 
> **That is okay!** Your posts don't need to be revolutionary or extraordinary to be read and shared. You simply need to highlight **YOUR** path rather than acting as a passive learner.

# **Ways to learn in public**

You do not need to do all of the following, doing one or two is more than enough.

* Write blogs, tutorials, and cheat sheets on things you learn.
    
* Speak at conferences, and meetups if you feel you are experienced enough.
    
* Ask and answer questions on websites like Stackoverflow and Reddit
    
* Make YouTube videos and Twitch streams.
    
* Start a newsletter.
    
* Teach workshops.
    
* Summarize what you've learned from conferences and videos and share them online.
    

For example, I often [tweet](https://twitter.com/atharvas_twt) about what I’m learning and instantly, I get replies and messages from people, who give me advice and tips on how to learn it.

I publish [blogs](https://theamazingatharva.hashnode.dev/) from time to time on what I have learnt and share my experience and display my learnings through code samples and bullet points.

**For Example:**

> " You can start learning in public right now. You don’t need a following. All you need is that first step to put yourself out there. …start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time ”
> 
> \- Shawn Wang

The good news is you don’t need permission to start a blog, launch a newsletter, create a YouTube account, start a podcast, draw, illustrate, code, build or write.

Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning. There is always something new to learn in this field, and you must enjoy the process of tackling difficult problems and finding creative solutions.

When you do so - **share your progress, learnings and eventual victory**.

# Several reasons why a programmer chooses to learn in public:

1. **Accountability**: Sharing your learning process with others can help you stay motivated and accountable to your goals. When you know that others are following along, you may be more likely to stay focused and committed to learning.
    
2. **Sharing knowledge:** By sharing your learning process with others, you can help others who may be interested in the same topic. This can be a great way to contribute to the community and give back to others who are also learning.
    
3. **Networking:** Sharing your learning journey can help you connect with other learners and professionals in your field. This can lead to new opportunities, collaborations, and professional relationships.
    
4. **Growth:** Learning in public can be a great way to reflect on your own learning and progress. By writing about or discussing your learning, you can gain a deeper understanding of the material and solidify your knowledge.
    
5. **Constructive Feedback**: Getting input from an expert or someone who has mastered the material is preferable when you are learning something new. Because it will indicate which one you should concentrate on and what you need to learn more about.
    
6. **Personal Branding:** Having an internet profile where you share your journey is crucial at a time when people can readily share their views and learn new things. Because if someone doesn't know you, they can look at your profile to find out who you are and what you've learnt so far. Your online resume is your profile.
    
7. **Grounded Principles:** As one grows a presence online one typically treats oneself as you'd treat a close friend, learning in public fosters "compassionate alignment with reality." When necessary, you'll encourage them, calm them down, and assist in maintaining a more concentrated course of action.
    

Overall, learning in public can be a valuable experience for programmers and can lead to personal and professional growth. It's a great way to stay motivated, share knowledge, connect with others, and reflect on your learning.

# Here are some steps you can take to start learning in public:

1. **Identify your learning goals:** What do you want to learn, and why? Write it down. Having clear goals will help you to stay focused and motivated. Keep referring to these goals to stay motivated to learn.
    
2. **Choose a platform**: There are many platforms you can use to share your materials such as those mentioned above. Choose a platform that best suits your needs and start posting.
    
3. **Start sharing:** Begin sharing your learning journey with others. You can share updates, reflections, resources, and insights as you progress. This will not benefit you by keeping track of your progress levels but also help others discover new mediums to learn.
    
4. **Engage with others:** Engage with others who are following your journey, and seek out feedback and support. This can help you get valuable insights from others and increase your social skills.
    
5. **Be consistent:** To make the most of learning in public, it's important to be consistent and regularly share updates on your learning journey. This can help you to build a following and stay engaged with your learning goals. You can also meet people who are on a similar learning path to collaborate and share.
    

# Important Note:

It is important to keep in mind that sharing your thoughts online will not always be all roses. Your comfort and patience will be tested but it is important to face your early struggles head-on.

> It's good if you feel awkward or like an imposter. You are exerting effort. Do your best despite not assuming you know everything, and when you are unavoidably incorrect, let the internet correct you. Put your humbleness on display.
> 
> Do people think you're awful? Good. You concur. Ask them to elaborate on the reasons you are terrible. Do you want to be good or just feel good?
> 
> No concerns, No resentment.
> 
> No pain, No Gain!!!

# Conclusion :

What you should do after reading this blog is create a hashnode blog where you will tag me (@[Atharva Salitri](@TheAmazingAtharva)) and share your learning from this blog, how you plan to **#LearnInPublic** and what you will be sharing. Don't hesitate to share your work or feel reluctant because you don't think you have much to share.

The goal is to learn, to become part of the knowledge chain. If you keep your knowledge separate from the rest of the world, you're missing out on some of the incredible benefits that the public realm has to offer. When you study in public, you become part of a community of people on the same path as you, dealing with the same issues, problems and failures. There is no pressure to not know anything and you can learn at your own pace.

> "Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by being told, even by the teacher, they must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves."
> 
> \- Allan Bloom

As time goes by and you learn more and hone your skills, the content you share will add credibility to your work and showcase the depth of your understanding. The showcase of knowledge you create can act as your unique portfolio and ultimately lead to productive opportunities in your field of interest.
