Hey folks, AI, IoT, Blockchain, and analytic technologies primarily work with massive amounts of data we couldn't even imagine in addition to that need huge storage space & computational power.

Have you ever wondered where this much amount of data going? If so, then the answer is **"Cloud"**. It is the only viable way to perform tasks like this.

Let's learn the Cloud Computing First!üôÇ

## What is Cloud Computing?

> It is the delivery of on-demand computing resources everything from applications to data centers over the Internet on a pay-for-use basis.

Let's imagine a scenario where you have a great idea to build an application that requires a lot of storage, and networking yes you can build everything from the starch. But here is the catch what if you do get everything you want as a service? Sounds cool right !!ü§©

***ü§†This is where the cloud comes into the picture.***

## Essential Characteristics ‚ö†Ô∏è

Defining characteristics varies from organization to organization sometimes from person to person.

Here I just filtered out the 5 essential and the most common characteristics of the cloud.

### 1.On-demand Self-Service

As I said earlier we can access resources such as processing power, storage, & network using a **simple interface**. Users no longer rely on that particular cloud service provider to get access.

### 2.Broad Network Acess

You can access cloud services over the network & on portable devices like mobile **phones, tablets, laptops & desktop computers**.

It was one of the best ways to get access to your cloud services regardless of the device you using.

### 3.Resource Pooling

It is nothing but multiple customers can share physical resources using multi-tenant mode it allows customers to share the **same application or infrastructure** while maintaining *privacy & security*.

### 4.Rapid Elasticity

Probably it is one of the main reasons why the cloud evolved so quickly. Cloud resources are dynamically **assigned & reassigned** according to the demand without customers needing to concern themselves with the physical location.

It simply puts you can access more resources when you need them & scale back when you don't.

### 5.Measured Services

**You can only pay for what you use**. Mostly it will be in subscription if you want to extend more you can. The users need to pay the resources they used at the end of the month.
